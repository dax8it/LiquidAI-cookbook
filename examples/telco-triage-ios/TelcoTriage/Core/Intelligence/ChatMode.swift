/// A first-class chat-mode classifier. The mode gate is the primary
/// branch in the telco support chat flow:
///
///  - `.kbQuestion`      → generative retrieval over the 32-entry KB
///                         (`KBExtractor` emits `[cite_passage(...)]`).
///  - `.toolAction`      → `ToolSelector` picks one of 8 tools and
///                         fills parameters; user confirms; tool runs.
///  - `.personalSummary` → grounded on `CustomerContext`, not the KB.
///                         ("Summarize my home network.")
///  - `.outOfScope`      → decline locally or escalate to cloud.
///
/// This replaces the TF-IDF-driven `SupportRouter` path that couples
/// retrieval to routing. Routing is now a pure LFM decision; retrieval
/// happens only on the question branch and is itself generative.
///
/// Production implementation is `LFMChatModeRouter`, backed by the
/// base LFM2.5-350M on device (or a sidecar backend — same protocol,
/// injectable). `StubChatModeRouter` is the compile-only deterministic
/// stub used in tests and during the BUG-022 on-device inference
/// outage so the surrounding pipeline stays exercisable.
///
/// **Multi-turn note (ADR-024)**: ADR-023 Phase 1 once added a
/// `classify(query:history:)` overload that pre-pended prior turns
/// to the prompt. ADR-024 retired that approach — the parse-failure
/// surface area on the 350M base proved the brittleness in production.
/// Multi-turn signal now flows through the pairwise relational heads
/// on cached hidden states (see `RelationalHeadsStrategy`). The
/// chat_mode router stays strictly single-turn — heads inform,
/// deterministic routers decide.
