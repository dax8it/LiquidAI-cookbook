///  2. **Scaffolding under BUG-022** — while on-device LFM inference
///     emits only `<|pad|>` tokens, the production app cannot rely
///     on `LFMChatModeRouter`. `StubChatModeRouter(mode: .kbQuestion)`

///     extraction, tool selection, handlers) stay runnable and
///     testable end-to-end.

/// This stub does NOT perform keyword matching, TF-IDF, or any lexical
/// primitive — per the architectural directive that routing is a pure
/// LFM decision. If you need behavior-per-query in a test, use
/// `ScriptedChatModeRouter` (below) which matches by prompt substring.
