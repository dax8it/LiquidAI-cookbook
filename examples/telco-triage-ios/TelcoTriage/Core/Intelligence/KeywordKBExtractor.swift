/// Deterministic KB retrieval over curated aliases. Replaces the
/// brittle classifier-head and embedding-RAG approaches as the
/// PRIMARY KB extractor.
///
/// Why this exists (first-principles):
///   The KB has hand-curated aliases for every entry — that's a hard
///   ML signal and we should use it. A keyword/token-overlap matcher
///   is:
///     - 100% accurate when the query contains an alias (the common
///       case: "pause internet" → parental-controls; "ssid" →
///       find-wifi-name)
///     - Sub-millisecond on iPhone (no LFM forward pass)
///     - Impossible to silently regress on (no model retraining)
///     - Trivially debuggable (which alias matched, what score)
///
///   Embedding RAG was the wrong primitive here: the classifier
///   adapter we trained collapses fine-grained KB entries inside the
///   same intent class (parental-controls, firmware-version, and
///   find-wifi-name all classify as `device_setup`, so their
///   embeddings cluster together — fatal for retrieval).
///
///   Production RAG: BM25/keyword first, embeddings only for
///   paraphrase fallback. We mirror that here.
