/// Chip → primitive table:
///
///  1. Grounded Q&A (RAG)             → retrieve KB, LFM synthesizes grounded answer
///  2. Tool call + device extraction  → toggle-parental-controls, pauses device in CustomerContext
///  3. Agentic diagnostics            → run-diagnostics tool → LFM summarizes telemetry
///  4. Location extraction            → reboot-extender with extender_name="upstairs"
///  5. Personalization                → LFM summarizes CustomerContext profile
///  6. Privacy boundary               → intent=unknown → LFM composes on-device-only decline
